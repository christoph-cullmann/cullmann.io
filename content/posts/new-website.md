After several years of failing to update my personal WordPress page, I restarted my website with the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/).

The new website uses zero cookies (yes, no stupid cookie question) and no kind of analytic software.

I hope my [Impressum](/impressum/) is done well enough to avoid any legal issues.

At the moment the website is still very empty, I hope to fill in more content about my open source projects and academic stuff in the near future.
