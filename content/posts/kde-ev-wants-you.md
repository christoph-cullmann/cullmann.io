At the moment, the yearly KDE conference [Akademy](https://akademy.kde.org/2019) is taking place in Milan.
The yearly [KDE e.V.](https://ev.kde.org) meeting will be tomorrow.

KDE e.V. is a registered non-profit organization that represents the KDE Community in legal and financial matters.

For example the KDE e.V. is responsible for paying the servers that run our Phabricator/Bugzilla/Gitlab instances and all our web sites.
KDE e.V. takes care of sponsoring developer sprints and contributor travel costs, too.

If you are a KDE contributor, consider to join the e.V. to get some vote about its direction.

If you want to join, just take a short look at [this guide](https://ev.kde.org/getinvolved/members.php).
