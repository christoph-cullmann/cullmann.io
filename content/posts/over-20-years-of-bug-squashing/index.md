The open source project I work on for the longest time is [KDE](https://www.kde.org) and there more specific [Kate](https://kate-editor.org).

This means I look at user bug reports for over 20 years now.

The statistics tell me our team got more than 9000 bugs since around 2001 (just for Kate, this excludes the libraries like KTextEditor that we maintain, too).

That is a bit more than one bug per day for over two decades.

And as the statistics show, especially in the last years we were able to keep the open bug count down, that means we fixed a lot of them.

Given we are a small team, I think that is a nice achievement.

We not just survived over 20 years, we are still alive and kicking and not just a still compiling zombie project.

Thanks a lot to [all people](https://kate-editor.org/the-team/) that are contributing to this success!

Let's keep this up in the next year and the ones following.
