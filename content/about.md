## Professional Life

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [AbsInt Angewandte Informatik GmbH](https://www.absint.com/).

My work is focused on static analysis of both binary and source programs and the WCET analysis of embedded systems.

## Open Source Projects

In my spare time, I work for example on the [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) project and maintain the Kate/KWrite editor and the KTextEditor framework.

A list of the projects I contribute to are collected on the [Projects](/projects/) page.
