### Random other stuff

Other KDE related contributions can be found on my [invent.kde.org profile](https://invent.kde.org/cullmann).

Contributors to these projects are welcome.

If you wish to sponsor the work done by KDE in non-technical ways, please think about [donating](https://kde.org/donations).
