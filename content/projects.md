## KDE

I work on various projects that are under the [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) umbrella.

* The Kate editor, a full-featured text editor
 * https://kate-editor.org/
 * https://invent.kde.org/kde/kate/

* The KTextEditor framework, a versatile text editor component
 * https://api.kde.org/frameworks/ktexteditor/html/
 * https://cgit.kde.org/ktexteditor.git/

* The Syntax-Highlighting framework, close to 300 languages supported
 * https://api.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting/html/
 * https://cgit.kde.org/syntax-highlighting.git/

Contributors to these projects are welcome.

If you wish to sponsor the work done by KDE in non-technical ways, please think about [donating](https://kde.org/donations).

## GitHub

Some smaller things I work on can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/) account:
